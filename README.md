# ðŸ§¥ Invisible Cloth (Python + OpenCV)

This is a fun computer vision project built using **Python** and **OpenCV** where a specific color cloth (like red) becomes "invisible" on cameraâ€”just like Harry Potter's cloak!

This was my **first ever Python project** exploring the world of real-time video processing and background subtraction.

## ðŸŽ¯ What It Does

- Captures live webcam video
- Detects a specific color (e.g., red)
- Replaces that color region with the static background
- Creates an illusion of invisibility!

---

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
